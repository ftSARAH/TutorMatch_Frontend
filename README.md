# TutorMatch_Frontend
The repository for the front-end is dedicated to the React-based user interface of the TutorMatch platform. It contains all the code, components, styling (CSS/SCSS), and other resources needed to build the client-side application. This part of the application interacts with the back-end via APIs.
